# Readme


##### By: Vivian || Filomena
## Description

For this project we were allocated 2 days to complete the task at hand. Make a React based website that consumes an API and utilises Bootstrap Framework. Filomena and I decided to work with and create a Movie Gallery where users can like movies and add them to their watch lists. We also incorporated a search bar to allow users to filter by category. The schedule was tight and our ability to work effectively was integral to us being able to submit this on time.


### Deployment link


- The project is available to view on my Github page. Link below :-

### Getting Started/Code Installation


**Client Side**
- npm i axios
- npm i react-router-dom
- npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap
- npm run dev

**Confirm the above are present in the package.json*

### Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)


This was a 2 person team project and we were allotted 2 days for completion 


### Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code - For writing code
- Chrome - For debugging
- Insomnia - For Testing Endpoints
- Netlify - For final Deployment
- GitHub - For version control and Branch Control

### Brief

This was my first experience working with React and we were given a very short period of time to get to grips with it. Additionally this project also incorporates Axios to receive data from an API and Bootstrap Framework. We used a custom Movie API that provided us with brief data of each of the movies and a utilised localstorage to save user preferences. Adding the SearchBar was added towards the end to add more functionality.

### Build/Code Process

- **Day 1:** 
Setup Frontend and Connect Database
Sketch out layout design for website
Defined the movie model and what kind of dat we wanted to display on the cards
Confirm correct data is being received
Setup Front-end with Vite
Install necessary Packages
Draw out layout for the pages needed
Begin working on logic to receive data


- **Day 2:** 
Add pages /Search/ and Styling 
Add ability to Like and Watch films
Create single view page
Add search bar and filter category logic
Add additional styling to pages with bootstrap
Test functionality

### Challenges	
We worked on Replit to complete this project. It provided an interesting set of advantages and disadvantages. We were able to share and solve each other's issues on a code block which while learning is helpful in being able to see changes take effect. On the flipside we were not able to work on different parts of the project as with the way react operates we kept getting little errors and were not sure where they were coming from.

### Wins
- Personally not having any experience working with another person on a project and considering how well coordinated and efficient our roles were, being able to meet our goals and work well as a team was the biggest win.

- Considering how tricky and new working on Replit was, we were able to complete the task at hand

### Key Learnings/Takeaways
We’ve utilised local storage to store data about likes and watches which is a first for me. We can access this through all the pages and it really helped in adding more interactivity to the page.
My team-mate Filomena was able to implement the search bar into the project that in hindsight almost feels like an essential going forward to add more interactivity for the user . 
Going forward I would presume on a larger scale the use of Github to complete tasks with a team of individuals would be more preferable so as to allow each member to work on different aspects of the same project simultaneously.

### Future Improvements

While the styling is adequate. I would like to add a few more finishing touches to ensure the project has more individuality.
